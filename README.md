# evescripts
A collection of Python scripts for Excel in space

## Why this?
I don't like apps. They almost never do exactly what I need them to do.
I prefer using a combination of spreadsheets and scripts for most of my number crunching needs.
If you are like me, you may find something useful here.
Then again, if you are exactly like me, you will probably rather want to write your own scripts.
Whatever, steal whatever you find handy.

## How to use this
Most scripts come with instructions. Some don't. Deal with it.

## There is almost nothing here?!
That's right. There may be more to come, though.
